# rs-ast

Sandbox for playing with tree structures. Just to get a handle on parsing.
I chose regular expressions as the language to parse, because (a) I'm familiar with them; and (b) I might need to use a modified regex library for building regex-based tokenizers. 

As with so many people, I found a lot of inspiration in Russ Cox's blog posts at
https://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/.
